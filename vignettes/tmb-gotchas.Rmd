A grab-bag of things to be aware of when writing code that will get used in TMB.

## Arrays are one dimensional under the hood

A ``tmbutils::Array``, whilst based on an Eigen array, manages dimensions
itself. As a result if you call any inherited Eigen methods, dimensions can
disappear.

From https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/structtmbutils_1_1array.html:

> Methods that are not documented here are inherited from the Eigen library and applied on the underlying n-by-1 array. In general this will yield surprising results for 2D specific array methods.

## Has to be some kind of return value

The return value in a g3 model, ``nll'', can't just be a hard coded value, has
to be e.g. a parameter There has to be at least 1 parameter, otherwise there
will be an Eigen error on return.

Obviously not a huge practical problem, but easily crops up in unit tests.

## Autofilling vectors

Can't do ``vector = single_value``, have to use ``vector.setConstant(single_value)``.

g3 will mostly handle this automatically, but seems like something that could
be fixed in TMB.

## Parameter ordering

When parameters are provided to TMB, they are flattened into one big vector. As
a result they need to be flattened in the expected order. When providing
defaults TMB will do this for you, but when calling the model it expects it to
be already done.

Also, in ``?MakeADFun``:

```
Do not rely upon the default arguments of any of the functions in
the model object ‘obj$fn’, ‘obj$gr’, ‘obj$he’, ‘obj$report’. I.e.
always use the explicit form ‘obj$fn(obj$par)’ rather than
‘obj$fn()’.
```

The following seems to re-order in the expected way, but seems naff:

    params <- list(... unordered params ...)
    par <- unlist(params[names(environment(model_cpp)$model_parameters)])

We could abstract, but there's probably a better solution.

## VECTORIZE1_t macros

The "R-like" functions TMB provides, such as ``lgamma()`` are defined using the
``VECTORIZE`` macros. These macros expect a single symbol, and will produce
mysterious errors if an expression is used.

Instead of ``lgamma(alpha + beta)``, do something like:

    lgamma_arg = alpha + beta; val_vec = val_vec + lgamma(lgamma_arg);
